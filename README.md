## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create a program that could display, add and update a theoretical company database using a command-line interface!
### Behind the scenes, this program heavily relies on MySQL, and the following packages: inquirer, to prompt the user, and MySQL2, to integrate and talk to MySQL databases!
### This assignment was very difficult for me, but I managed to get through! The syntax for MySQL is very particular and learning the ins and outs of it took some extra research.

## Installation

Simply download the files, run 'npm install' to get the required packages!<br>
Afterwards, either create a 'company_db' with your own schema or just run both of my schema files with the 'source' command in MySQL!

## Usage

After doing the procedure done during installation, just run 'node index' in the command line within the folder and follow the prompts given!<br>
Note: You may need to update the code at the very top of the page for your specific MySQL password information for your root user!

## Video
